# This file contains my SKHD config
# SKHD allows me to change applications on MacOS with shortcuts
# SKHD - https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/tree/master
# To update any of these config, make the changes here and restart the skhd process with
# skhd --restart-service
#
#
# note: might need to run a `skhd &` to kick of skhd on a restart.. should probably get this going automatically at some point
