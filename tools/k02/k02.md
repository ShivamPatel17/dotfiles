# K02

- bought from https://ergohaven.xyz/
  - set up the keyboard with https://ergohaven.xyz/docs/k02
    - latest firmware here https://github.com/ergohaven/vial-qmk/releases
    - to install, unplug the k02. Then while holding the top right key on the right pad, plug in the k02 to power.
      - then open the folder from Finder and there should be a text file and some ko2.txt too. Drag the firmware in the folder. Then the keyboard will automatically reboot.
